### Marli Yaru Dark Pink Edit

Yes, I am still looking for a better name

## Prerequisites

I developed this for myself (Ubuntu 20.04/Gnome 3.36). It may be possible that it also works for other versions.

## Installation

You should have installed the "User-Themes" extension in gnome-tweaks.
In my case, it works fine putting this directory into `~/.themes`

Then you should be able to pick it in "Appearance" next to "Applications" and "Shell".

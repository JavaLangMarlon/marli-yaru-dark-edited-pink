### Marli Yaru Dark Pink Edit

Yes, I am still looking for a better name

## Prerequisites

I developed this for myself (Ubuntu 20.04/Gnome 3.36). It may be possible that it also works for other versions.

## Installation

You should have installed the "User-Themes" extension in gnome-tweaks.
In my case, it works fine putting this directory into `~/.themes`

Then you should be able to pick it in "Appearance" next to "Applications" and "Shell".  

## Preview

![Preview Image](https://github.com/JavaLangMarlon/marli-yaru-dark-edited-pink/blob/main/preview.png?raw=true)

This is my desktop environment as of March 2021, using a digital art wallpaper i found here: https://free4kwallpapers.com/uploads/originals/2020/01/23/digital-art-k-wallpaper.jpg

I also used `dconf-editor` to make my docker bar transparent.
